Aadam Ali's shoppify test using Rails

In order to test my API I used mysql2 and xamp to connect to the sal server
and also to connect to the rails server. 

Faker was used to generate random information for testing.

Some of my routes may not be fully functional as I ran out of time when doing the bounus however
they show my clear understanding of how rails works as well as an API used to shop.

Used the rails command line commands to make table relations, dependencies, etc.

Used postman chrome to test get requests and posts.
